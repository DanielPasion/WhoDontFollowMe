# Python Script to See who does not follow you back
Hello! This is a quick python script that uses the Selenium Python Library to scrape the people you follow to see who does not follow you back. It uses the Instagram Graph API and can only be done with your own account UNLESS you obtain other people's user_id's through view page source and searching for profile_id.

**Run terminal.py to start**
- Type in the username of the person you want to check (only can do yourself at the moment)
- Login to your account through the web browser that was opened.
- Once logged in, type in ready in the terminal   
- Should be good from here
### Todo: 
- Implement an easier way to check other people's accounts that are not your own
- Create a UI
- Create a chrome extension
